## TODO: 
Things that would be nice to have: 
- Copy button on features, traits...
- Dark mode (very nice to have) 
- Disable buttons on no spell slots 
- More Condense Tables on the character sheet. Maybe combined ability scores, combat stats 


## TO FIX: 
- Not centered text on the character sheet page 


# Stats or the nerds: 
- GO 
- HTMX 
- TAILWINDCSS 
- Like 1 javascript function
- YAML goodness

Builds for systems should be available in the builds folder but HTML is not embedded.
 
I would recommend building and running for your system with the go run ./cmd/web/
